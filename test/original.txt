Five people have died after a gunman opened fire at a block of flats in Toronto,
Canada.
Police responded to reports of the shooting at the building in Vaughan, about 30km (19
miles) north of Toronto, at 19:20 (12:20 GMT) on Sunday, shooting the suspect dead
there.
Another injured person has been taken to hospital in a serious condition.
Authorities are investigating the motive, including a possible connection between the
gunman and the victims.
York police chief Jim MacSween said attending officers were met with a "horrendous
scene", with numerous deceased victims found in different flats of the building.
"We're in the process right now of doing notifications to those families, so at this point I
can't share any information on the victims or the subject," he said.
Ontario's Special Investigations Unit, which probes police-involved deaths in the region,
said in a press statement that the dead is a 73-year-old man.
Mr MacSween said there was no ongoing threat to the public, and York police said
those evacuated could return to their homes.
In a tweet, Vaughan's mayor Stephen Del Duca extended condolences to the families of
the victims.
"I want to recognise the brave first responders who are working to safeguard the
situation," he added.
Ontario's premier, Doug Ford, also offered his condolences, writing on Twitter that he
was "shocked and saddened" to hear about the shooting.
"All of Ontario is thinking of the victims of this senseless violence and the family and
friends grieving their loss," Mr Ford said.
While it has fewer mass shootings than the US, Canada has recently seen an increase
in gun violence prompting recent legislation to ban handguns.

Canada bans handguns following deadly shootings
In May 2020 Canada banned 1,500 types of military-grade or assault-style firearms after
a gunman disguised as a policeman killed 22 people in Nova Scotia.
